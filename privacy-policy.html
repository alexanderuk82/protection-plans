								On our website we use the marketing and remarketing services of
								Google.
							</p>
							<p class="my-5">
								These services allow us to display advertisements in a more
								targeted manner in order to present advertisements of interest
								to users. Through remarketing ads and products are displayed to
								users relating to an interest established by activity on other
								websites within the Google Network. For these purposes, a code
								is used by Google when our website is accessed and what are
								referred to as (re)marketing tags are incorporated into the
								website. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small
								file, is stored on the user’s device (comparable technologies
								may also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by
								various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net,
								invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or
								googleadservices.com. This file records which apps users have
								visited, which content they are interested in and which offers
								have been used. In addition, technical information about the
								browser and operating system, referring websites, the length of
								the visit as well as any additional data about the use of the
								online products and services are stored. The IP address of users
								is also recorded, although we would like inform you that within
								the framework of Google Analytics, IP addresses within Member
								States of the European Union or in other contracting states to
								the Agreement on the European Economic Area are truncated. All
								user data will only be processed as pseudonymous data. Google
								does not store any names or e-mail addresses. All displayed ads
								are therefore not displayed specifically for a person, but for
								the owner of the cookie.

								This information is collected by Google and transmitted to and
								stored by servers in the USA. One of the Google marketing
								services we use is the online advertising program Google
								AdWords. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer
								receives a different conversion cookie. Cookies can therefore
								not be tracked through the websites of AdWords customers. The
								information collected by the cookie is used to generate
								conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for
								conversion tracking. AdWords customers see the total number of
								users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with
								a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive any
								information that personally identifies users. We may include
								third-party advertisements based on the Google Marketing Service
								called DoubleClick. DoubleClick uses cookies to enable Google
								and its partner websites to place ads based on users’ visits to
								this website or other websites on the Internet. Google services
								make use of Google’s Tag Manager. For more information about
								Google’s use of data for marketing purposes, please see the

			<p class="my-5">
				We work with Contact State in order that we can pass on your request to
				our partners correctly. Contact State provides lead validation services
				to us and our insurance provider partners and their intermediaries.
				Contact State receives “de-identified” data from us about your request –
				this means devoid of any contact information, or anything else
				identifying you as an individual person in the “real world”. It uses
				that de-identified data to help confirm your request has been submitted
				by a “real” human and not a robot, or automated request generator. This
				is done by examining a “browser fingerprint” associated with your
				request – it contains, for example, details of the model of device you
				are using, your Internet browser, and the region from which you submit
				your request. Contact State retains that de-identified data for its own
				purposes as “data controller” and uses it to help verify requests
				submitted through other websites.
			</p>
			<p class="my-5">
				If you do not want us to pass your de-identified data to Contact State,
				please contact us by emailing admin@amesmo.com. We also use Contact
				State to check some basic details in your submission (for example, the
				postcode), and to route your submission in its “raw” plain-text form to
				the insurance providers and intermediaries we work with. In doing this,
				Contact State acts as our “data processor” – it does not use the raw
